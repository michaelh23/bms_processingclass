## Activity 1

Take the graph paper provided and draw the shapes that would be drawn by this code:

	1. line(220, 390, 240, 370);
	2. line(260, 390, 280, 370);
	3. rect(100, 150, 200, 200);
	4. triangle(100, 150, 300, 150, 200, 50);
	5. ellipse(200, 230, 100, 50);
	6. point(280, 320);
	7. rect(250, 280, 30, 70);
	8. point(350, 50);
	9. ellipse(50, 50, 60, 60);
	10. line(320, 20, 380, 80);

## Activity 2

Take the graph paper provided and draw the shapes that would be drawn by this code:

	point(350, 350);
	ellipse(100, 100, 100, 100);
	line(50, 250, 100, 50);
	rect (200, 250, 100, 50);
	triangle(350, 50, 370, 150, 300, 100);
	rect(200, 200, 50, 50);
	line(200, 100, 300, 50);
	ellipse(350, 200, 60, 40);
	triangle(70, 200, 130, 170, 110, 230);
	point(50, 350);

Looking at the following image, write the code that would draw these shapes.  Hint, small black squares are points.

## Activity 6

On graph paper, design/draw a creature/character of your own using the shapes you have learned so far.  Color your creature including the outline colors.

Once you have drawn a creature/character on your graph paper and colored it, take out a piece of lined paper and begin writing the code for your creature.

background(); //comes first

stroke(), fill(), etc. comes above the object or line you want to effect.

Drawing Functions:  point(), line(), rect(), rectMode(), ellipse(), triangle()
Color Functions:  stroke(), fill(), background(), noStroke(), noFill()

When using RGB in your stroke, fill, and background, be purposeful and know what color you are trying to make and document it in your comment 

Use COMMENTS for EVERY part of your drawing so you know what your code is doing and remember to include what color you intend.

Have fun!!

## Activity 7

Using the sketchbook on www.openprocessing.org you will write your code for your creature and see if it will run :-)
