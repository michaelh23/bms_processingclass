## Activity 1

Take the graph paper provided and draw the shapes that would be drawn by this code:

	1. line(220, 390, 240, 370);
	2. line(260, 390, 280, 370);
	3. rect(100, 150, 200, 200);
	4. triangle(100, 150, 300, 150, 200, 50);
	5. ellipse(200, 230, 100, 50);
	6. point(280, 320);
	7. rect(250, 280, 30, 70);
	8. point(350, 50);
	9. ellipse(50, 50, 60, 60);
	10. line(320, 20, 380, 80);

## Activity 2

Take the graph paper provided and draw the shapes that would be drawn by this code:

	point(350, 350);
	ellipse(100, 100, 100, 100);
	line(50, 250, 100, 50);
	rect (200, 250, 100, 50);
	triangle(350, 50, 370, 150, 300, 100);
	rect(200, 200, 50, 50);
	line(200, 100, 300, 50);
	ellipse(350, 200, 60, 40);
	triangle(70, 200, 130, 170, 110, 230);
	point(50, 350);

Looking at the following image, write the code that would draw these shapes.  Hint, small black squares are points.

## Activity 5

Fix the errors in the following code statements:


	// 1.
	background(); 

	// _______________________________________________

	// 2.
	stroke 255;

	// _______________________________________________

	// 3.
	fill(150)

	// _______________________________________________

	// 4.
	rectMode(center);

	// _______________________________________________

	// 5.
	function draw()

	}           

	// _______________________________________________

	// 6.
	createCanvas(windowWidth, Height);

	// _______________________________________________

	// 7.
	line(100, 130, 210);

	// _______________________________________________

	// 8.
	noStroke( ;

	// _______________________________________________

	// 9.
	fill(255,0);

	// _______________________________________________

	// 10.
	rect(100,100,50)

	// _______________________________________________

## Activity 6

On graph paper, design/draw a creature of your own using the shapes you have learned so far.  **Only use up to six shapes and up to four lines**.  Color your creature including the outline colors.  **Name** your creature
 
Once you have drawn a creature on your graph paper and colored it, take out a piece of lined paper and begin writing the code for your creature.
 
- background() comes first
 
- stroke(), fill(), etc. comes above the object or line you want to affect.
 
- Drawing Functions:  point(), line(), rect(), rectMode(), ellipse(), triangle()

- Color Functions:  stroke(), fill(), background(), noStroke(), noFill()
 
When using RGB in your stroke, fill, and background, be purposeful and know what color you are trying to make and describe it in your comment

Look back to the <a href="/outline/#graphing-shapes">Class Outline</a> if you need a reminder about how to use rect, line, ellipse, etc.
 
**Use COMMENTS for EVERY part of your drawing so you know what your code is doing and remember to include what color you intend.**

## Activity 7

Go to your account on www.openprocessing.org, create a new sketch and type in the code for your creature and see if it will run.  :-)

If it doesn't, try to determine what is wrong.
