## More on Processing

If you are interested in any of the books about Processing, they currently all teach the original Processing language which is a little different than what you are using on OpenProcessing.org.  You are using P5.js there.  The following link provides some information about converting between the two languages.  It is meant for the ambitious.  (Where it starts talking about "Some things about JavaScript" is probably most pertinent at this point):

## Inform - Writing Text Adventures

<a href="http://inform7.com/" target="_blank">Inform</a> is a language for writing text adventures, otherwise known as Interactive Fiction.  Such games present the world to you in words and language.  The player types commands and the world changes.  Very old school yet some pretty powerful works of fiction have been created.

Inform comes with a complete environment for creating these adventures for Windows, Mac and other environments.  The programming language Inform is designed to read like plain english.  For example, this is a sample from the documentation.  This describes a room and some objects in a sample game.  This is actually code that can be run in the Inform language:

    "Cave Entrance"

    The Cobble Crawl is a room. "You are crawling over cobbles in a low passage. There is a dim light at the east end of the passage."

    A wicker cage is here. "There is a small wicker cage discarded nearby."

    The Debris Room is west of the Crawl. "You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from the surface. A low wide passage with cobbles becomes plugged with mud and debris here, but an awkward canyon leads upward and west. A note on the wall says, 'Magic word XYZZY'."

    The black rod is here. "A three foot black rod with a rusty star on one end lies nearby."

    Above the Debris Room is the Sloping E/W Canyon. West of the Canyon is the Orange River Chamber.
